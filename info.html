<h1>Information about Pok&eacute;mon</h1>
<div id=pokemon style="background-color:#ffaaaa">
<b>Basic Info</b><br>In the world of Pok&eacute;mon, animals (and some plants) are replaced by creatures called Pok&eacute;mon. Pok&eacute;mon live in the wild or alongside people. People can capture them and store them within pok&eacute;balls to carry them around and interact with them in any way they please. The most common use of Pok&eacute;mon is to use them in battle against each other where two or more of them fight each other until one faints (this is not as inhumane as it sounds). A large portion of the Pok&eacute;mon world revolves around battles.

<b>Types</b><br>Pok&eacute;mon are categorized based on what type they are. Some Pok&eacute;mon have a sort of elemenal type such as fire, water, or electricity, while others have simpler types such as bug, flying, or fighting. Pok&eacute;mon can have up to two different types (but most only have one) while the first is the primary type. A Pok&eacute;mon's type will largely be based on its lifestyle and battling style. Different types have advantages over each other in battle as shown in the table below.

<b>Stats</b><br>The strengths and weaknesses of different Pok&eacute;mon are shown by different stats. Each has a different set of hit points, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed. Hit points, or HP, is a measure of endurance to show how much damage a Pok&eacute;mon can take before it faints. Attack is a measure of how strong this Pok&eacute;mon will be in delivering physical attacks. Defense is a measure of how well a Pok&eacute;mon can defend against a physical attack. Special attack is similar to attack, but it is in relation to special (non-physical) attacks. Special defense is similar to defense, but it is in relation to defending against special attacks. Speed is a measure of how fast a Pok&eacute;mon is so that it can try to attack before its opponent in battle.
